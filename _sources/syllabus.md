## Course description

This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the programming
language Python in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and data analysis.  The target audience is anyone who wants
to do their own data analysis.  The course will culminate with a
peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis project on either a
pre-specified dataset or a dataset of your choice.

## Logistics

* Course website: <https://roualdes.github.io/MATH131>

## Course Structure

**Asynchronous**: this class is fully online and asynchronous.

There are no set meeting times, but assignments still have due
dates. Lectures are all pre-recorded and linked from the class
website. Students work through the Lessons and complete assignments at
their own pace. Here's some <a
href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/notes/01e_async_protocol.html"
target="_blank">slides</a> that might help fill in some details on the
course format.

## Canvas usage

Generally speaking, this course website will be used instead of
Canvas.  A link in Canvas leads to this website.  Canvas will only be
used for announcements and friendly reminders to the class.

## Student support

### office hours

For the first five weeks of the semester (1/21/2025 - 2/21/2025), my
office hours will be in the <a href="https://library.csuchico.edu/innovation-lab" target="_blank">Meriam Library Innovation
Lab</a>

* Mondays 1pm - 2.30pm
* Tuesdays 1pm - 2.30pm
* Thursdays 11am - 11.50am
* Fridays 2pm - 3.45pm

If none of those times work for you, please email me so that we can
find a time that works for us both: eroualdes@csuchico.edu

### Discord

To facilitate peer to peer and effective instructor to peer assistance
Discord will be used for discussion and questions outside of
class. This server hosts students across multiple Statistics and Data
Science classes, with a specific channel for all sections of Math 131.

* Click this link to join the server: https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5
* Verify your email and agree to the rules and code of conduct. This
  helps create a safe learning environment.
* Go to the `#class-selection` text channel in the left sidebar,
  choose your pronouns (optional but helpful), and click the Snake
  icon emoji under any post to self-assign you to the Math-131
  role. this will let you see and access the class channels.
* Post a question or 10 to the Math-131 channel.


### Community Coding

Similar to drop in Mathematics tutoring hours, students, staff,
faculty, and the public are invited to join our Community Coding
sessions.  Bring your computer, coding projects, and your questions to
this open working environment.

Schedule and info found at <https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml>.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Import data into Python from external files such as text files and spreadsheets.
* Calculate summary statistics.
* Create new variables using different data types.
* Perform data management techniques such as filtering, grouping, and summarizing/aggregating.
* Create informative data visualizations and tables.
* Create a reproducible research document.
* Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.


## Schedule of Topics

The general outline of topics is listed below.

* Week 01

    * Introduction to the Python language and Google Colab

    * Conducting reproducible research within a Colab notebook using Markdown and Python code

* Week 02

    * How to use functions

    * Introduction to data processing

* Week 03

    * Univariate Data Visualization using base, and plotnine graphics

    * Data processing and Aggregation with Pandas

* Week 04

    * Bivariate and Multivariate Data Visualization using ggplot2

    * Importing data into Python from external files

* Week 05

    * Exploratory Data Analysis (individual project)

## Required Materials

* A reliable laptop, chromebook, or tablet that can use a browser to
  access the internet.

* Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.

Students who do not have a computer (i.e. a iPad or Chromebook) can
use the Wildcat virtual lab


## Time commitment

> For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
> “credit hour” is defined as … not less than one hour of classroom or
> direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of
> out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks
> for one semester or trimester hour of credit.

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class
during these 5 weeks.  That’s 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of
homework per week.  If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with
computers, you may end up taking more time.  Be sure to schedule
sufficient time during Week 05 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it.  Recall this is
just a co-curriculuar or supplemental introductory class.  You will
not learn everything there is to know about Python, nor necessarily
feel proficient by the time you are done. But you will be on a better
path towards learning Python than when you started.

## Grading

Credit / No Credit. There are 100 points available in this course. You
must earn 75 points to receive credit for the course.

* Complete Assignments: 4 @ 10 points each
* Fill out course Notes: 4 @ 7.5 points each
* Project:
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (20 points)
    * Peer Review (10 points)

Assignments and Notes are due after each week, Sunday by midnight.

Any assignment can be submit as late within the week after it is due
for a one point deduction.

Assignments are submit by uploading the appropriate files to a Google
Drive shared notebook, which I will create for you.  The shared Google
Drive folder will be named MATH 131 Assignments for
[student-username], where [student-username] is your student username.
Only, specifically, you, me, and the course graders will have access
to this folder.

## Class policies and statements

### Everyone is welcome here

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race,
nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged
and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness
of the course for you personally, or for other students or student
groups.

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion,
ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those
  that appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!

* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your
  experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us.
  We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous
  feedback (which may lead to a general announcement to the class, if necessary
  to address the concerns). Please use our Google form named [Anonymous
  feedback](https://forms.gle/GSjiCLi6xwXQ3N28A).  You must be signed in with
  your campus Google account student_username@mail.csuchico.edu to access the
  form, but we do not record (hence anonymous) any information about how submits
  feedback.

* If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
  Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu

* We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about
  diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
  (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me
  about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

### Appreciation

We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that
were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the
Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship
with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through
campus.

We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since
time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do
so today.
