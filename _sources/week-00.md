# Week 00: Start here

MATH 131: Introduction to Python is a 1 unit, 5 week course offered at Chico
State through the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  The course consists
Lessons and Assignments.  We will learn to code in the programming language
Python using Google Colab notebooks.  Lessons, Assignments, and Google Colab
notebooks are discussed in more detail below, and there is a link to a Google
Colab notebook that better introduces this programming environment.

### Lessons

Lessons found on this website.  Lessons contain the explanations of what's to
come in the assignments.  Examples and all.

### Assignments

For assignments, we'll use Google Colab with your username@mail.csuchico.edu
account (same password as your username@csuchico.edu account).

### Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) provides a notebook
environment where the user can develop a reproducible document that blends text
and code together.  Such reproducible documents are popular in the world of data
science, statistics, machine learning, and the various applied sciences that use
programming.  By combining text and code, you can walk (via text) your audience
through an analysis (usually via code and/or math), showing the exact code you
used to draw any conclusions about the data or otherwise.

We will use Google Colab for free, as part of your campus Google account
username@mail.csuchico.edu.  The free aspect means we'll have to deal with some
issues that don't otherwise come about if we were to install Python on our own
personal machines.  I, Edward, have made the active choice to use Google Colab
instead of teaching you how to install Python on your personal machine,
because I believe we can get started faster this way.  If you want to follow
along with this course using different tools, please see the details on the
page [Week 06 and beyond][and-beyond.md].

From here, there's really no better way to learn about Google Colab than to go
touch it.  Here's a link to [the Colab notebook associated with Week 00: Start
